Creation of a basic Maze program ...

## Project infos 

- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Deadline**: 25 novembre 2020, 19h
- **Team challenge**: solo 


## What is this project about :grey_question:

This is a web development exercise carried out with the BECODE training to learn various aspects and coding techniques. Here there will be very little HTML, CSS according to everyone's preferences and mainly JavaScript.

## Objectif

- Using loops and the DOM to generate simple templates. 
- Using keyboard events

### Pre-requisite :bowtie:

What you need to get started ...

- basics in **HTML**
- basics in **CSS**
- basics in **JavaScript**
- Top work mates or a good ability to do internet research on your own :muscle: 

## What did I use?

- Generating JavaScript code from HTML code
- the function
- the Condition 
- the EventListener
- the loop
etc.

## Strength

- Create your first game.
- Playing with other people's games.
- The result is rather nice, when you have never done this before in your life and the coding is all new to you.
- it is a very concrete exercise that allows you to assimilate the notions of JavaScript


## Weaknesse

- I didn't have a good knowledge of JavaSript ...:disappointed:
- Knowing where to start.
- Wanting to do better and not always knowing how to do so. 
- The labyrinth is not in 3D.
- To really put a character in motion.
- my last level doesn't work, so I'll work on it again.


## Advice

Do your best to surpass yourself! The goal is to make a project correct, but do your best to go further.
